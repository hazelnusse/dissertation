This dissertation explores bicycle dynamics through an extension of the Whipple
bicycle model and validation of the model equations equations of motion through
the implementation of a robotic bicycle. An extended Whipple bicycle model is
presented which makes uses of a unique set of physical parameters based on
cylindrical gyrostats. The nonlinear equations of motion for this model are
derived, linearized, and validated against a set of benchmark model parameters.
A general formulation for the linearization of a system with configuration and
velocity constraints is presented, and is demonstrated on an idealized rolling
disk. The method of linearization is directly applicable to the equations of
motion which result from the application of Kane's method. The linearization
procedure is used to formulate the linear state space equations of motion for
the bicycle model, which are then used as the plant model to design the robotic
bicycle control system. The mechanical, electrical, and software aspects of the
robotic bicycle are presented, along with representative results from a set of
experiments.
