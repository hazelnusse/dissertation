\section{Introduction}
The bicycle model we use assumes the bicycle is composed of four rigid bodies:
two wheels, a frame, and a fork. These rigid bodies are assumed to be connected
by three frictionless revolute joints: one between the rear wheel and frame,
one between the front wheel and fork, and one between the bicycle frame and the
fork. The rigid wheels are modelled as torii which make point contact with the
ground plane. The frame and fork are each assumed to to be inertially
symmetric about in their respective $XZ$ planes. The revolute joint connecting
the frame and fork is assumed to be parallel to the $Z$ axis of the
each respective body. It is assumed that each wheel mass center lies in the
$XZ$ symmetry plane of the body to which it is connected, and that each wheel
revolute joint axis is parallel to the $Y$ axis of each respective body.

\section{Bicycle parameters}
The physical parameters used to describe the four rigid bodies, their interface
with each other and the ground plane is of practical concern for several
reasons. The choice of parameters determines how many quantities must be
measured or calculated when characterizing a real bicycle; some parameters are
more difficult to measure than others. The choice of parameters has a direct
effect on the complexity of the equations of
motion~\cite{Wittenburg2008,Mitiguy2001}, and by extension, the computational
cost associated with simulating or performing stability analysis of the
equations. Most importantly, the choice of parameters can greatly affect the
ease of understanding how changing a single parameter affects the dynamics.
Finally, having a common, agreed upon set of parameters which permit direct
comparisions is very valuable in communicating results to others -- if
everybody uses different parameters to describe the same model, comparisons
become difficult and error prone. We refer to the parameters used
in~\cite{Meijaard2007} as the ``Meijaard parameters'' (this is not the first
use of this parameter set, but it is the most clearly presented and widely
distributed work describing the choice). The Meijaard parameters have been
adopted as the \textit{de facto} by many authors~\cite{Sharp2008}. They can be
measured reasonably simply~\cite{Moore2010b}, and many of the parameters are
familiar to those outside academic circles (i.e., the bicycle industry, and
everyday cyclists). Examples of commonly recognizable parameters available at
your local bike shop include wheelbase $w$, trail $c$, and steer axis tilt
$\lambda$. For these reasons, this choice of parameters is indispensable.

There are strong reasons to prefer other choices of parameters. The Meijaard
parameters are ideally suited to direct derivation of linearized equations of
motion, about the upright zero steer configuration. The reason for this is that
the Meijaard parameters are defined with respect to the bicycle \textit{in the
upright zero steer configuration} and with respect to a set of body fixed
coordinates that are aligned with the inertial frame \textit{only in this
configuration}. Deriving nonlinear equations of motion with this parameter set
is cumbersome and requires a number of intermediate geometric quantities to be
introduced. A serious disadvantage of the Meijaard parameter set is the
coupling between the parameters. Consider, for example, a parameter study
investigating the effect of front wheel radius on stability. Using the Meijaard
parameters, a naive approach might be to choose a set of parameters and compare
the eigenvalues for that set with the eigenvalues when only the wheel front
wheel radius is changed. Unfortunately, this does not represent the act of
taking a real bicycle (with some set of parameters) and simply changing the
front wheel to one with identical mass and inertia but different radius.
Changing the front wheel radius of a real bicycle changes the steer axis tilt,
wheelbase, trail, center of mass locations relative to the rear wheel contact,
and, by virtue of the inertia scalars being defined relative to an inertial
frame, six of the inertia scalars. Thus, if the goal of an analyst or designer
is to understand the difference between how front wheel radius affects a
bicycle stability (a reasonable goal), and that person uses the Meijaard
parameter set to describe the bicycle, no fewer than \textit{thirteen}
additional parameters must be adjusted: the wheelbase $w$, trail $c$, steer
axis tilt $\lambda$, the central inertia scalars $I_{\text{B}xx}$,
$I_{\text{B}zz}$, $I_{\text{B}xz}$, $I_{\text{H}xx}$, $I_{\text{H}zz}$,
$I_{\text{H}xz}$, and the scalars describing the center of mass locations of
the bicycle frame and the fork $x_\text{B}$, $z_\text{B}$, $x_\text{H}$, and
$z_\text{H}$. This coupling of parameters is the result of defining the
parameters with respect to the reference configuration. If the naive approach
is used anyway, and all other parameters are left unchanged as
in~\cite{Moore2008,Tak2010}, it must be realized that when comparing results
which have only one of these coupled parameters changed (e.g., front wheel
radius), one is actually comparing bicycles with different frame and fork
geometry, center of mass location, and mass distribution since these must be
changed (on a real bicycle) in order to keep the Meijaard parameters constant.
Stated simply, one is not comparing effect of only front wheel radius, but the
effect of changing the front wheel radius and thirteen other parameters. The
practical utility of such a comparison is dubious at best. While this issue
\textit{can} be addressed by carefully changing the thirteen coupled parameters,
to our knowledge, no parameter study to date has done this. This is a rarely
stated, but critical, downside of the Meijaard parameters.

The easiest way to remedy the issue of parameter coupling is to choose physical
parameters which can be defined independent of configuration. This is standard
practice in robotics: robot link lengths are defined relative to the previous
link in the chain, and mass and inertia properties of each link are defined
with respect to a link-fixed coordinate system which is independent of overall
robot configuration. The thirteen Meijaard parameters which are defined
relative to the reference configuration can be arranged into three groups and
addressed separately. First, the wheelbase $w$, trail $c$, and steer axis tilt
$\lambda$ can be replaced with three distances which are independent of
configuration, as in~\cite{Franke1990}. Two of these measure the perpendicular
distance between the wheel centers and the steer axis while a third measures
the distance parallel to the steer axis between the first two lines. Second,
the bicycle frame and fork center of mass locations relative to the rear wheel
ground contact ($x_\text{B}, z_\text{B}, x_\text{H}, z_\text{H}$
in~\cite{Meijaard2007}) can be replaced with parameters which are defined
relative to the rear and front wheel centers, respectively. Finally, the
central inertia scalars of the bicycle frame and fork ($I_{\text{B}xx},
I_{\text{B}zz}, I_{\text{B}xz}, I_{\text{H}xx}, I_{\text{H}zz}, I_{\text{H}xz}$
in~\cite{Meijaard2007}) can be replaced with inertia scalars defined relative
to body-fixed coordinate systems which are aligned with a features fixed in the
body (such as the steer and wheel axes).

This section carefully describes the physical parameters used to model the
bicycle. These parameters address the issues raised in the previous two
paragraphs and also reduce the number of parameters needed to describe the same
four rigid bodies. This reduction is possible because the inertial properties
of rear frame and rear wheel are independent of the orientation of the rear
wheel relative to the rear frame (and similarly for the front fork and front
wheel). This parameterization of the physical properties of the bicycle is
collectively referred to as the gyrostat parameters. Finally, we present the
conversion from the Meijaard parameters to the gyrostat parameters.

\subsection{Gyrostat parameters} \label{model:gyrostat_parameters}
A gyrostat is a mechanical system of one or more bodies which has the rigid
body property that its inertia scalars are time independent
constants~\cite{Wittenburg2008}. The most common example of such a system is a
motor with a rotor which is inertially symmetric about the spin axis. As the
rotor rotates relative to the frame of the motor, neither the location of the
mass center nor the combined inertia of the system changes. This type of
gyrostat is referred to as a cylindrical gyrostat~\cite{Mitiguy2001}. The two
body cylindrical gyrostat is typically described as being composed of a carrier
and a rotor. A bicycle wheel and frame or fork is exactly such a gyrostat.

To aid the discussion which follows, we present the relationship between the
parameters which fully describe a cylindrical gyrostat and the parameters which
fully describe the two composing bodies. First consider a carrier $A$ with a
set of mutually perpendicular axes $X$, $Y$, $Z$ intersecting at the mass
center $A^*$ of $A$. $A$ has mass $m_A$, and let $\uv{a}{x}, \uv{a}{y},
\uv{a}{z}$ be unit vectors parallel to $X$, $Y$, $Z$, respectively, and express
the inertia dyadic of $A$ for $A^*$ as $\bm{I}^{A/A^*} =
I_{Axx}\uv{a}{x}\uv{a}{x} + I_{Ayy}\uv{a}{y}\uv{a}{y} +
I_{Azz}\uv{a}{z}\uv{a}{z} + I_{Axz}(\uv{a}{x}\uv{a}{z} + \uv{a}{z}\uv{a}{x})$.
$A$ is inertially symmetric about the $XZ$ plane. Attached to $A$ with a
revolute joint is rotor $B$ with mass $m_B$. Fixed to $B$ is a set of
mutually perpendicular axes $X'$, $Y'$, $Z'$, intersecting at the mass center
$B^*$ of $B$. Let the revolute joint axis be $Y'\parallel Y$, assume that $B^*$
lies in the $XY$ plane, and express the inertia dyadic of $B$ for $B^*$ as
$\bm{I}^{B/B^*} = I\uv{a}{x}\uv{a}{x} + J\uv{a}{y}\uv{a}{y} +
I\uv{a}{z}\uv{a}{z}$ (i.e., $B$ is inertially symmetric about the $Y'$ axis).
Let $\bm{r}^{B^*A^*} = a \uv{a}{x} + b \uv{a}{z}$ be the position vector
from the mass center of rotor $B$ to the mass center of carrier $A$.  Let $G^*$
denote the center of mass of $A$ and $B$ and let us refer to the cylindrical
gyrostat simply as $G$. The cylindrical gyrostat has mass
\begin{align}
  m_G &\triangleq m_A + m_B
\end{align}
and the position vector from $B^*$ to $G^*$ is
\begin{align}
  \bm{r}^{B^*G^*} &= \frac{m_A}{m_A + m_B}\left(a \uv{a}{x} + b \uv{a}{z}\right)
\end{align}
The inertia dyadic of $G$ for $G^*$ is
\begin{align}
  \bm{I}^{G/G^*} &= \bm{I}^{A/G^*} + \bm{I}^{B/G^*} \notag \\
                 &= \bm{I}^{A/A^*} + \bm{I}^{A^*/G^*} + \bm{I}^{B/B^*} +
                 \bm{I}^{B^*/G^*} \notag \\
%
                 &= \underbrace{\left(I + I_{Axx} + \frac{m_A m_B}{m_A + m_B}
               b^2 \right)}_{\triangleq I_{Gxx}}
                 \uv{a}{x}\uv{a}{x} \notag \\
%
                 &+ \underbrace{\left(J + I_{Ayy} + \frac{m_A m_B}{m_A + m_B} \left(a^2 +
               b^2\right)\right)}_{\triangleq I_{Gyy}} \uv{a}{y}\uv{a}{y} \notag \\
%
                 &+ \underbrace{\left(I + I_{Azz} + \frac{m_A m_B}{m_A + m_B}
               a^2 \right)}_{\triangleq I_{Gzz}}
                 \uv{a}{z}\uv{a}{z} \notag \\
%
                 &+ \underbrace{\left(I_{Axz} - \frac{m_A m_B}{m_A + m_B} a b
               \right)}_{\triangleq I_{Gxz}}
               \left(\uv{a}{x}\uv{a}{z} + \uv{a}{z}\uv{a}{x}\right)
\end{align}
where $\bm{I}^{A^*/G^*}$ denotes the inertia dyadic relative to $G^*$ of a
(fictitious) particle situated at $A^*$ and having a mass $m_A$ (similarly for
$\bm{I}^{B^*/G^*}$)~\cite{Kane1985}. Describing the dynamics of a gyrostat in
terms of $m_G, I_{Gxx}, I_{Gyy}, I_{Gzz}, I_{Gzz}, I_{Gxz}$, and $J$ (six
parameters) is substantially simpler than describing simpler than describing
the dynamics in terms of the parameters fundamental to each individual rigid
body $m_A, m_B, I, J, I_{Axx}, I_{Ayy}, I_{Azz}, I_{Azz}$, and $I_{Axz}$ (eight
parameters). This is partly due to the simple fact that there are two fewer
parameters to consider, but also due to significant simplifications that occur
when forming generalized inertia forces~\cite{Mitiguy2001}.

We assume the bicycle rear frame and rear wheel form a cylindrical gyrostat of
the same type as the example just presented, as do the fork and front wheel.
The bicycle may be considered to be composed of two such cylindrical gyrostats
whose carriers (the frame and fork) are connected by a revolute joint -- the
steer axis. It is natural to consider how many parameters are needed to
describe a bicycle using this formulation. In addition to the six inertial
parameters, each gyrostat requires five more parameters: two torus radii, two
distances defining the mass center location relative to the wheel axis and
finally the distance from the wheel axis to the steer axis along a
perpendicular to the steer axis. Thus eleven parameters are need to describe
each cylindrical gyrostat. One more parameter is necessary to define the
distance along the steer axis, between the line segments from each wheel center
to the steer axis. Thus, a total of twenty three parameters fully characterize
the model. These parameters are shown in \autoref{model:tab:parameters}. Some
of the parameters are illustrated in \autoref{model:fig:bicycle}.

  \caption{Bicycle gyrostat parameters. To distinguish whether they are a
    property of the rear or the front gyrostat, the first 11 parameters are
    subscripted with $r$ or $f$. For example, $m_r$ denotes the rear gyrostat
    mass, while $J_f$ denotes the front wheel spin moment of inertia. The steer
  axis separation $l_s$ is a property of how the two gyrostats are connected and
hence is not subscripted in this fashion.}

Measuring the 23 (21 if the wheels are assumed to be knife edged) parameters
for a real bicycle is very similar to the procedure described
in~\cite{Moore2010b} except fewer measurements are needed. Instead of
determining the mass, mass center locations, and mass distribution of four
individual bodies, equivalent properties of only two cylindrical gyrostats need
to be measured. Practically speaking, this means only two masses need to be
measured (instead of four), the mass center locations and gyrostat inertia
measurements should be performed with the rear wheel and frame (front wheel and
fork) rigidly connected (i.e., wheel unable to spin), and the wheel moment of
inertia about an axis in the wheel plane needn't be measured (the wheel spin
inertia still does need to be measured, however). The time and energy savings
of the experimenter is fairly minor, however, the measurement of the fork
inertia can be problematic if the torsional pendulum stiffness is such that the
oscillations frequency are relatively high; by measuring the inertia of the
fork and wheel together, this is issue is mitigated to some degree. An
alternative method is to measure the exact parameters as described
in~\cite{Moore2010b}, and convert them to the gyrostat parameters as described
in \autoref{model:parameter_conversion}.

%The rear wheel is modelled as a rigid torus and is completely characterized by
%5 constant parameters: the major and minor radii, the mass, and two moments of
%inertia (one about the axis of symmetry, the other about any line in the wheel
%plane). The rear frame is modelled as a rigid body with unspecified geometry
%other than the spin axis of the wheel and steer axis which connects it to the
%fork. It is assumed that the two axes are perpendicular, that the frame is
%inertially symmetric about the plane perpendicular to the wheel spin axis, and
%that the steer axis lies in this symmetry plane. The bicycle frame is equipped
%with a dextral set of unit vectors: $\bm{r}_x, \bm{r}_y, \bm{r}_z=\bm{r}_x
%\times \bm{r}_y$ with $\bm{r}_y$ parallel the wheel axis and $\bm{r}_z$
%parallel to the steer axis. As described, the rear frame is completely
%characterized by 8 parameters: one distance between the wheel and steer axes as
%measured in the symmetry plane along a line perpendicular to the steer axis,
%two distances between the wheel spin axis and the mass center in the symmetry
%plane, the mass, and four central inertia scalars ($\bm{r}_x$ and $\bm{r}_z$
%are not assumed to be principal axes). If the rear wheel plane symmetry is
%constrained to lie in the bicycle symmetry plane, 13 parameters to completely
%describe these two bodies. Treated together, we can compute the combined mass,
%center of mass location (relative to the wheel axis), and the combined inertia
%about the center of mass. The combined mass and combined inertia represent 6
%unique scalar quantities as opposed to the 8 when the two bodies are considered
%separately. By describing the rear frame and rear wheel in terms of these
%combined parameters rather than the parameters intrinsic to each individual
%body, we use 2 fewer parameters. The same arguments apply to the  front fork
%and front wheel (replacing $\bm{r}_x, \bm{r}_y, \bm{r}_z$ with $\bm{f}_x,
%\bm{f}_y, \bm{f}_z$, respectively). With one final parameter describing the
%distance along the steer axis between the two bicycle frame and fork, we
%completely describe the bicycle with 23 parameters (11+11+1=23). See figure
%XXX.

\subsection{Parameter conversion}\label{model:parameter_conversion}
If the bicycle model in~\cite{Meijaard2007} is extended to use toroidal wheels
(as opposed to knife edged), and all Meijaard parameters remain otherwise
unchanged, a total of 27 parameters describe the bicycle model.  The two extra
parameters are the rear and front wheel minor radii, which we denote with
$t_\text{R}$ and $t_\text{F}$, respectively. The mapping from this 27
dimensional parameter space to the 23 dimensional gyrostat parameter space is
surjective -- distinct choices of Meijaard parameters can yield equivalent
gyrostat parameters (and hence identical dynamics). The practical implication
of this is that given a set of gyrostat parameters, it is not generally
possible to determine a unique set of the Meijaard parameters. This should not
be surprising given that it can be shown with dimensional analysis that the
minimal parameter space (assuming $t_\text{R}=t_\text{F}=0$) is only 9
dimensional~\cite{Sharp2008} (presumably it would be 11 dimensional if
$t_\text{R}$ and $t_\text{F}$ are included, though this has not been
verified).

In the equations that follow, the symbols used for the parameters presented
in~\cite{Meijaard2007} are on the right side of the equality, while the symbols
used to describe the gyrostat parameters are on the left of the equality. Some
parameters have very similar symbols but should not be confused as being the
same (i.e., $m_\text{f} \ne m_R$). Of the 23 gyrostat parameters, the following
6 have identical counterparts in the Meijaard parameters
\begin{align}
  J_r &= I_{\text{R}yy} \\
  R_r &= r_\text{R} \\
  r_r &= t_\text{R}\\
  J_f &= I_{\text{F}yy} \\
  R_f &= r_\text{F} \\
  r_f &= t_\text{F}
\end{align}
The rear and front gyrostat masses are trivially related
\begin{align}
  m_r &= m_\text{B} + m_\text{R} \\
  m_f &= m_\text{H} + m_\text{F}
\end{align}
With $s_\lambda=\sin\lambda$, $c_\lambda=\cos\lambda$, the mass center locations are related as
\begin{align}
a_r &= \frac{m_\text{B}}{m_\text{B} + m_\text{R}} \left(c_{\lambda} x_\text{B}
- s_{\lambda} \left(r_\text{R} + t_\text{R} + z_\text{B}\right)\right) \\
b_r &= \frac{m_\text{B}}{m_\text{B} + m_\text{R}} \left(c_{\lambda}
\left(r_\text{R} + t_\text{R} + z_\text{B}\right) + s_{\lambda} x_\text{B}\right) \\
a_f &= - \frac{m_\text{H}}{m_\text{F} + m_\text{H}} \left(c_{\lambda} \left(w -
x_\text{H}\right) + s_{\lambda} \left(r_\text{F} + t_\text{F} + z_\text{H}\right)\right) \\
b_f &= \frac{m_\text{H}}{m_\text{F} + m_\text{H}} \left(c_{\lambda}
\left(r_\text{F} + t_\text{F} + z_\text{H}\right) - s_{\lambda} \left(w -
x_\text{H}\right)\right)
\end{align}
The three parameters which describe the perpendicular distance of the wheel centers from the
steer axis, and the distance between these perpendicular lines are
\begin{align}
c_r &= c_{\lambda} \left(c + w\right) - s_{\lambda} \left(r_\text{R} +
t_{R}\right) \\
c_f &= c_{\lambda} c - s_{\lambda} \left(r_\text{F} + t_\text{F}\right) \\
l_s &= - c_{\lambda} \left(r_\text{F} - r_\text{R} + t_\text{F} - t_\text{R}\right) + s_{\lambda} w
\end{align}
The central inertia scalars of the two gyrostats in terms of the Meijaard
parameters are
\begin{align}
I_{rxx} &=
I_{\text{R}xx} +
c_\lambda^2 I_{\text{B}xx} - 2 s_\lambda c_\lambda I_{\text{B}xz} + s_\lambda^2
